    Assign strict ordering to image pixels. Outputs an array that has the same size as the input.
    Its element entries correspond to the order of the gray level pixel in that position.

    This implements the method by Coltuc et al [2,3] which takes increasing uniform filter sizes to
    find the local means. It takes an argument for the order (called k in the paper) which must be
    at least 2 and defaults to 6.

    The idea of using local neighbors was originally proposed in [1] and if order=2 is used on 2D
    images this reproduces that concept.

    Assign strict ordering to image pixels. The returned value is the same shape as the image but
    with values for each pixel that can be used for strict ordering. For some types of images or
    large orders this will return a stack of image values for lex-sorting.

    This implements the method by Coltuc et al [2,3] which takes increasing uniform filter sizes to
    find the local means. It takes an argument for the order (called k in the paper) which must be
    at least 2 and defaults to 6.

    Their method has been adapted to work in 3D, however only isotropic data is supported. The order
    parameter is based on distance so an order of 6 will include some pixels for 2D images (distance
    of 2*sqrt(2)) that are not included in 3D images (order 6 only goes up to sqrt(6) away).

    This uses the psi functions from [3] so they don't include redundant information or scaling
    factors as those won't change the relative order. The results are compacted as much as possible.

    The idea of using local neighbors was originally proposed in [1] and if order=2 is used on 2D
    images this reproduces that concept.
